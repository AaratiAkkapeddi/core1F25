        <h1>Project 5: Shifting Perspectives</h1>
        <p>
<strong>First, read <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PNgTuAq1sW1WV7HykAm2ZXn1fY-EExD5/view?usp=drive_link">Shannon Matternâ€™s article in Avant</a>.</strong> 
Design and code a single page that presents two different perspectives of the same content, using CSS media queries to create distinct experiences for desktop and mobile viewing. This assignment explores how context shapes perception and how responsive design can be used not just for layout adaptation, but for conceptual storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Concept</strong>:</p>
<p>Consider how we experience things differently depending on our context. A phone is intimate, personal, held close. A computer screen is often more associated with work and viewed from more of a distance. Your design should reflect these different viewing contexts and how they might change the way we understand or interact with your content.
</p>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements
</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>One HTML file</li>
    <li>CSS using at least one media query (minimum breakpoint at 768px)
Significantly different layouts/presentations between mobile and desktop views
Both versions must be fully functional and intentionally designed (not just "responsive by default")
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conceptual Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Your design should explore perspective shift in a way that relates to your harmonic collection theme. </p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What changes between contexts? (hierarchy, emphasis, information revealed/hidden, tone, mood)</li>
    <li>How does viewing distance/intimacy affect the experience?</li>
    <li>What's appropriate for each device context?</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick Example Conceptual Approaches:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Desserts: Desktop content reflects a communal meal at a full table, vs on mobile it's more about solo eating showing a recipe for just one. </li>
    <li>Furniture: Desktop content reflects furniture for shared public space, vs on mobile it's more about furniture for the intimate space of the home. </li>
</ul>
        <p><strong>Due <strong>10/28 9am</strong>
            </strong></p>
        
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>In Canvas:</b> Submit a link to your Figma design. Your design must include a desktop and mobile version. ***Also submit a brief written explanation (2-4 sentences) describing: Your conceptual approach to the perspective shift, How the mobile vs desktop contexts informed your design decisions, Technical challenges you solved.
 </li>
            <li><b>In <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1XzDFxU0JaQJKgQPL-bW4zk8Os5-uRt_3">The Drive </a></b>: One HTML file (index.html), One CSS file (style.css)</li>
        </ol>


        <p><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></p>

        <ul>

            <li>Conceptual depth (30%): Clear, intentional perspective shift that engages with device context</li>
            <li>Design execution (30%): Both versions are polished, cohesive, and well-designed</li>
            <li>Technical implementation (30%): Clean code, effective use of media queries, semantic HTML</li>
            <li>Integration with portfolio theme (10%): Successfully connects to your larger body of work</li>

        </ul>
