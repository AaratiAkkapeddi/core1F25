        <h1>Syllabus</h1>
        <p id="description"> Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium—as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.</p>
        
        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>

        
By the end of the semester, students will be able to:<br>

<ul>
    <li>Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.
    Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great design concepts)</li>
    <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design, using incremental methods such as prototyping, user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.</li>

               <p><strong>Weeks 9-11: Designing for interaction</strong></p>
        <p>Thinking about a website as a series of linked pages, we’ll take the concepts we used to make individual web pages and apply them to larger systems.

        <h2>Class Project: Harmonic Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
        <p>You’re going to pick a theme to explore visually for the duration of the semester. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry to a collection that explores this theme. At the end of the semester, you’ll deliver a website that houses 10 programmed entries. The website container is part of the design, as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Full Description:</strong></p>
        <p>In mathematics, a sequence is defined as a series of numbers arranged in a predictable pattern. It’s a type of number set which follows specific, definite rules. When translated to design, sequencing is a natural part of systems — each individual item has unifying elements that when looked at as a whole, tells a larger story.</p>
        <p>In this class you’ll create a Harmonic Collection that explores a theme of your choice. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry into your collection that makes use of the design focus and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills we’re developing. First, you will pick a theme of your choice (think of it as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches). Your theme should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. (Example themes: Your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week). In the final weeks of the semester, you’ll refine your 10 entries so that they communicate a clear exploration and deliver a website that houses all of them together. You might need to re-organize or add additional content to your container or entries to fully realize your idea. </p>
        <p><strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>The website and all the entries must be responsive (work on a variety of screen sizes). </li>
            <li>While each entry will be unique, there should be unifying visual components between them</li>
            <li>All hyperlinks must be functional</li>
            <li>Each week’s entry will make use of that week’s design focus</li>
            <li>You will make use of a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to communicate a story</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><strong>Midterm Edit:</strong></p>
        <p>For Midterms, we will have a one on one meeting. At that time, you will present a refined iteration of your current collection. Prior to this meeting, you’ll chat with your fellow classmates about the following questions:
            <ul>
            <ol>What is your theme? Has it evolved from the initial description?
            </ol>
            <ol>How is the content communicating the theme? What about the design?
</ol>
            <ol>How would you describe the pacing of the collection so far? Does it feel considered? Can there be a moment for a dramatic break, or an acceleration?
</ol>
            <ol>Are there opportunities to establish a template or system to the design — if so, when, where, and how? Can we break the system mindfully to add interest?
</ol>
        </ul>
</p>
<p>
You will also prepare a short written doc (one paragraph) that explains your collection’s theme so far and explains three other avenues you can explore for the remaining weeks of the semester.

<h2>ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Learning a new skill is a challenging and iterative process. At times messy, it’s in these moments of frustration that we allow ourselves to grow and have a new experience. Do not rob yourself of the opportunity to do that.
</p>
<p>It is important to maintain a philosophy of learning, critical thinking, and independent problem solving throughout the class and to open ourselves up to the mental space of being challenged. ChatGPT can help you understand your code better and help you identify typos, however, it is not a substitute for learning how to code yourself, or developing creative solutions to the projects. Hands-on coding, visual experimentation, and diligence are all important skills in becoming a designer, and we should commit to developing these skills in the classroom and beyond. Using ChatGPT to complete your entire project is not permitted, nor can it be used for generating ideas. If you choose to do this, <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning" target="_blank">the person you’re disadvantaging is yourself</a>.
