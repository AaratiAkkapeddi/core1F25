      <h1>Hyperlink Poem</h1>
      <p>
Create a network of pages as a non-linear poem.

Each word or phrase is linked to another page that expands upon this poem or story. This poem can be purely text-based or include images like in Olia Liliana's *My Boyfriend Came Back from The War.* You must include at least 4 different pages/links

      </p>
      <p><strong>Questions to Consider
</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Think of all the paths someone might take through your website. They may all start at the homepage but from there, depending on what they click next, they could create different paths. Would there be one clear path to take, or are there many "forks in the road" ? Would each path evoke different feelings or a different poetic impression?
</li>
<li>Is your link poem made primarily of text, or are you including images too?
</li>
<li>Are you using your own text/images or are you basing your project off of an existing poem? If you are using an existing poem, what aspects of the original poem would you want to translate into a web-based experience and how?
</li>
<li>Consider how reading this poem on a page is different from navigating your website. Does the matter in which one clicks links change the structure/order of the poem?
</li>
</ol>

    <p><strong>Due Dates
</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>9/16</strong> - HTML of your project should be coded & you should have a figma design for your next steps. ðŸš¨ Keep it simple. We will go over things like fonts, colors, basic typography but you wonâ€™t be able to code complex layouts yet. Try to keep your layouts to 1 column for now and use only Google fonts or these <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php">web safe fonts</a>.
</li>
<li><strong>9/23</strong> - Project due. Using the CSS we learn in class on 9/16, translate your figma design into code.  Upload all your files here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1XzDFxU0JaQJKgQPL-bW4zk8Os5-uRt_3">Gdrive</a>
</li>
