      <h1>Internet Walk</h1>
      <p>Each week 1-2 students will 'walk' us through a website of their choice and tell us why they like it. We will list the websites below along with a 1 sentence description. Students may choose a website for a number of different reasons. Perhaps they are intrigued by a design, a novel structure, a nostalgic piece of internet history. The choice is completely open but the only rule is that the website should<strong> not be a major social media site (i.e. facebook/instagram/x)</strong></p>
      <p>This prompt is inspired by <a href="https://syllabusproject.org/syllabus-for-taking-an-internet-walk/" target="_blank">Taking an internet walk</a> by Spencer Chang and Kristoffer Tjalve.</em></p>
      <blockquote>we think, that our “internet” comprises the same 10 apps, some flooded with ads and spyware, others with people yelling about everything and nothing. We accept that the only way to get anything useful out of the internet is by trading our privacy for accounts and our self-expression for conformity. Everything is always somehow broken and when social spaces die, we believe that it is how it has always been and that nothing will ever be different.

We are here to take you by the hand and show you another Internet than the one sketched above. The Internet is so much vaster than a single worldview. It is a sprawling galaxy of archipelagos, filled with more humanity and personal gestures than any man-made archive. Instead of traversing the congested highways of the web, we invite you to try alternative routes: take a scroll down local streets and wandering paths, try out someone else’s commute, rediscover the favorites of your neighborhood, and gather the friends you love in your favorite spots, quiet and comforting. Beneath social media and app hedges, the blossoming internet awaits: a live ecosystem unfolding beneath our footsteps.</blockquote>
